# Task: Install Hook â€“ setup_commands

## Phases
### Phase 1: ðŸš€ Implementation
- [x] Add `setup_commands()` in `install.sh`:
  - copy templates â†’ generate commands â†’ sync to `.cursor/rules/`
- [x] Echo friendly status (âœ… Commands available via @rules/â€¦)

### Phase 2: ðŸ§ª Testing
- [x] `bash install.sh` on clean repo â†’ `@rules/*` available

### Phase 3: ðŸ“š Documentation
- [x] Document install step in `implement.md`

### Phase 4: ðŸ§¹ Cleanup
- [x] Idempotent re-runs; safe if directories already exist

### Phase 5: ðŸ’¾ Commit
- [x] `git add . && git commit -m "chore: install hook to hydrate/sync commands"`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Running install produces runnable `@rules/*` files
- [x] No duplicate files on repeated runs
