# Task: Execute-Tasks â€“ Orchestrator Runner

## Phases
### Phase 1: ðŸš€ Implementation
- [x] Flags: `--filter`, `--priority >=N`, `--max-parallel`, `--dry-run`
- [x] Outputs: `cb_docs/tasks/results/*.json`, aggregated `summary.md`

### Phase 2: ðŸ§ª Testing
- [x] DAG order, deadlock detection, retry budget, dry-run snapshot

### Phase 3: ðŸ“š Documentation
- [x] Usage + examples

### Phase 4: ðŸ§¹ Cleanup
- [x] Consistent exit codes; clear failure list

### Phase 5: ðŸ’¾ Commit
- [x] Commit

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Dry-run prints stable plan; real run streams status and halts on fatal

## Completion Summary

**TASK-2025-09-07-T4.1-orchestrator** has been successfully completed! ðŸŽ‰

### Phase 1: Implementation âœ…
- Created `OrchestratorRunner` class in `builder/core/cli/orchestrator_commands.py`
- Implemented all required flags: `--filter`, `--priority`, `--max-parallel`, `--dry-run`
- Added comprehensive output system: individual JSON results and aggregated summary markdown
- Integrated with existing `TaskOrchestrator` for execution management
- Created CLI commands: `execute-tasks`, `orchestrator:status`, `orchestrator:validate`

### Phase 2: Testing âœ…
- Tested DAG order generation with dependency analysis
- Verified deadlock detection using NetworkX cycle detection
- Confirmed dry-run functionality with stable execution plans
- Tested filtering by priority, tags, and specific task IDs
- Validated parallelism control and result collection

### Phase 3: Documentation âœ…
- Added comprehensive Execute-Tasks Orchestrator section to `implement.md`
- Documented CLI commands, options, and usage examples
- Included execution flow, output files, and implementation details
- Added error handling and exit code documentation
- Provided complete usage examples and integration points

### Phase 4: Cleanup âœ…
- Implemented consistent exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure)
- Added clear failure reporting with error messages
- Verified proper error handling for invalid inputs
- Confirmed stable execution plans in dry-run mode
- Tested result collection and summary generation

### Phase 5: Commit âœ…
- All changes committed successfully
- Task status updated to completed
- Documentation updated with completion summary

### Key Features Implemented

#### CLI Commands
- `cb execute-tasks` - Main execution command with full filtering and parallelism control
- `cb orchestrator:status` - Show orchestrator status and task summary
- `cb orchestrator:validate` - Validate task dependencies and detect issues

#### Command Options
- `--filter` - Filter tasks by tags (multiple values supported)
- `--priority` - Minimum priority threshold for task selection
- `--max-parallel` - Maximum parallel task execution limit
- `--dry-run` - Show execution plan without running tasks
- `--tasks` - Execute specific task IDs (multiple values supported)
- `--output-dir` - Custom output directory for results

#### Execution Features
- **Dependency Management**: Automatic task ordering based on dependencies
- **Parallelism Control**: Configurable parallel execution limits
- **Filtering**: Task selection by tags, priority, or specific IDs
- **Dry Run**: Execution planning without actual execution
- **Result Tracking**: Individual task results and aggregated summaries
- **Deadlock Detection**: Automatic detection of circular dependencies

### Generated Files
- `builder/core/cli/orchestrator_commands.py` - OrchestratorRunner class and CLI commands
- `cb_docs/tasks/results/` - Output directory for task results and summaries
- Updated `cb_docs/instructions/implement.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Integration Points
- **Task Index**: Reads tasks from canonical task index
- **Task Orchestrator**: Uses existing orchestrator for execution
- **Result Management**: Saves results to structured output directory
- **CLI Integration**: Full command-line interface with options

### Output Files
- **Individual Results**: `cb_docs/tasks/results/{task_id}.json` - Per-task execution results
- **Summary Report**: `cb_docs/tasks/results/summary.md` - Aggregated execution summary
- **Status Information**: Real-time execution status and progress reporting

### Next Steps
The Execute-Tasks Orchestrator is now ready for:
1. **Task Execution**: Execute tasks with full dependency management
2. **Parallel Processing**: Run multiple tasks simultaneously with control
3. **Result Analysis**: Comprehensive result tracking and reporting
4. **Integration**: Work with per-task commands and command generator

The orchestrator provides a complete solution for intelligent task execution! ðŸš€
