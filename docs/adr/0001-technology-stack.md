# ADR-0001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-09-06

## Context

We need to select a technology stack for the Payments system that can handle secure payment processing, receipt generation, and high availability requirements.

## Decision

We will use the following technology stack:

- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript for type safety and component reusability
- **Backend:** FastAPI with Python for high performance and automatic API documentation
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and reliability
- **Testing:** Jest for frontend testing, pytest for backend testing
- **Deployment:** Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration

## Consequences

### Positive
- Type safety across the entire stack reduces runtime errors
- Strong ecosystem support for all chosen technologies
- Good performance characteristics for payment processing
- Automatic API documentation generation
- ACID compliance ensures data integrity for financial transactions

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with TypeScript
- Python performance may be slower than compiled languages for some operations
- PostgreSQL requires more configuration than simpler databases
- Docker/Kubernetes adds operational complexity

### Neutral
- All technologies are well-established with good community support
- Migration paths exist for all components if needed
