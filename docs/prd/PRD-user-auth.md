# User Authentication System

## Overview
A secure user authentication system that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts with proper security measures.

## Problem
Users need a secure way to authenticate and access the application while maintaining their privacy and data security.

## Goals
- 99.9% uptime for authentication services
- < 2 second response time for login
- Zero security breaches
- 95% user satisfaction score

## Requirements
- User registration with email validation
- Secure password-based authentication
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- Logout functionality

## Metrics
- 99.9% uptime for authentication services
- < 2 second response time for login
- Zero security breaches
- 95% user satisfaction score

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to create an account with email and password
- As a user, I want to log in securely
- As a user, I want to reset my password if forgotten
- As a user, I want to log out securely

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- User registration with email validation
- Secure password-based authentication
- Password reset functionality
- Session management
- Logout functionality

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt
- Sessions must use httpOnly cookies
- All endpoints must use HTTPS
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Must integrate with existing user database
- Must comply with GDPR requirements
- Assumes users have valid email addresses

## Dependencies
- User database (PostgreSQL)
- Email service for notifications
- Redis for session storage

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Basic auth (2 weeks)
- Phase 2: Security hardening (1 week)
- Phase 3: Testing and deployment (1 week)

## Acceptance Criteria
- User can register with valid email and strong password
- User can log in with correct credentials
- User receives error for invalid credentials
- User can reset password via email
- User can log out and session is invalidated
- All authentication data is properly encrypted
- System handles rate limiting gracefully
