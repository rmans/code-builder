# Authentication Service Deployment

## Overview
Deployment strategy and infrastructure setup for the authentication service in production environment.

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Compute Resources
- **Application Server**: 2x t3.medium instances (auto-scaling group)
- **Database**: db.t3.micro PostgreSQL instance
- **Cache**: cache.t3.micro Redis instance
- **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer

### Network Configuration
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Security groups for database and application access
- SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS
- Route 53 for DNS management

## Deployment Pipeline

### CI/CD Process
1. **Code Commit** - Developer pushes to main branch
2. **Build** - Docker image creation and testing
3. **Test** - Automated test suite execution
4. **Security Scan** - Vulnerability scanning
5. **Deploy** - Blue-green deployment to staging
6. **Validation** - Smoke tests and health checks
7. **Production** - Blue-green deployment to production

### Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Environment Setup

### Production Environment
- **Database**: AWS RDS PostgreSQL with Multi-AZ
- **Cache**: AWS ElastiCache Redis with cluster mode
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs and metrics
- **Secrets**: AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive data

### Staging Environment
- **Database**: Single AZ PostgreSQL instance
- **Cache**: Single node Redis instance
- **Monitoring**: Basic CloudWatch logging
- **Secrets**: Environment variables

## Security Configuration
- WAF rules for common attacks
- Security groups with minimal access
- SSL/TLS termination at load balancer
- Database encryption at rest
- Secrets rotation policy

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Application performance monitoring
- Database performance metrics
- Error rate and response time alerts
- Security event monitoring
- Capacity planning alerts

## Backup and Recovery
- Automated database backups (daily)
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Cross-region backup replication
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Recovery time objective: 4 hours
